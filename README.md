# Open E-commerce App

Open Flutter Project E-commerce App is mobile application for e-commerce. We are building a commercially valuable product as an open-source project to make mobile technology accessible for small and medium businesses.

## The code Improvement Challenge

[Open Flutter Project: The Code Improvement Challenge](https://medium.com/@openflutterproject/open-flutter-project-the-code-improvement-challenge-ef04d9c6f716)

The idea behind the competition is to improve your Flutter development skills within a set period in a group of other enthusiasts. The challenge will last for a week when everyone can propose a code improvement for the app we build and submit it with a pull request.

**Improvements:**

1. Widgets. We have quite a few widgets to developed already that can be improved. The is an Easter Egg right in the article with a widget description. What you can do is optimize current widgets and their usage.

2. Bloc improvements. Things connected to events, states and Bloc can be revised as well. Read more on that in Flutter Bloc.

3. Flutter clean architecture implementation and improvements. You can do in this part updates for data or domain part of the app. You can find more info about Flutterâ€™s clean architecture here.

...any other propositions on code or architecture improvements.

## Flutter Version

You may need to update flutter to dev or beta for the most recent updates to work. Use following commands to upgrade flutter:

```
flutter channel dev
flutter upgrade
```
or

```
flutter channel beta
flutter upgrade
```

## Tests
To run tests use command below:

```
flutter run -t test/test.dart
```


## IDE settings
You need to update the configuration of your IDE to tell the location of the entry point.

The example for VS Code is below:

     "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Flutter",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "lib/main.dart",
            "type": "dart"
        }
    ]

To check the code quality with Flutter Analyzer (recommended when you want to add something) please run in console:

    flutter analyze

It should give no errors message:
